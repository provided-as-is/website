# PROVIDED AS IS ️🧩

## The Website

One day, this repo will contain the website for the ProvidedAsIs event.

...one day 😅 we still haven't got enough time to dedicate out efforts to this.

## How to contribute

Open an issue and suggest how we could do it, what features you'd like to see in it, which tech we should be using 🤗

## License

At the moment, we have decided to go for the standard MIT license.
