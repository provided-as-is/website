## The Quick Version

Provided As Is is dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable, and accessible environment for all participants. We will not tolerate any inappropriate behavior, remarks, images, or online posts. We will not tolerate harassment in any form. The use of sexual language and imagery will not be tolerated.

All organizers, attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at Provided As Is events - and contributors and participants in its repositories - are required to agree with the following Code of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout all Provided As Is affiliated events and in the repositories. We expect cooperation from all participants to ensure a safe, comfortable, and inclusive environment for everyone.

## The Less Quick Version

Everyone - attendees, sponsors, speakers, volunteers, and organizers included - is required to agree to and follow this Code of Conduct. Inappropriate behavior or harassment of any kind will not be tolerated.

Unacceptable behaviors include: intimidating, harassing, abusive, discriminatory, derogatory or demeaning speech or actions by any participant. This includes our online community, all Provided As Is meetups, conferences, and events, and one-on-one communications carried out in the context of the community.

Provided As Is is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience everyone, regardless of gender identity, sex, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, age, disability, body size or physical appearance. Harassment includes: prejudicial verbal or written comments, sexual imagery or inappropriate use of nudity of any kind (including in presentation slides), deliberate intimidation, stalking or following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Sponsors and speakers should not use sexualized or inappropriate images, activities, or other material in their advertisements or talks. We reserve the right to review all materials and remove them from distribution if they are determined to be inappropriate. Finally, anything that would make someone think "Hmmm, that's inappropriate" may also be unacceptable behavior.

Any participant asked to stop any harassing or inappropriate behavior is expected to comply immediately. We expect all participants to follow these rules at Provided As Is meetups, conferences, and affiliated events, as well as in our online communities.

### Reporting

If you feel uncomfortable, are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a Provided As Is organizer or volunteer immediately. At conferences and other large events, organizers and volunteers will be wearing specific badges, shirts, or other identifiable items to help you find them.

If you canâ€™t find an organizer or volunteer, [Provided As Is on Twitter](http://twitter.com/ProvidedAsIs) has DMs open and is monitored constantly. There is also an [email address](providedasis@gmail.com) you can reach out to.

### Enforcement

If a participant is asked to stop harassing or inappropriate behavior, they are expected to do so immediately. If a participant engages in harassing or inappropriate behavior, Provided As Is organizers reserve the right to take any action to resolve the situation immediately; this may include warning the participant, immediate expulsion from events with no refund, and/or banning from any future Provided As Is meetups, conferences, or affiliated events.

Our foremost concern is the safety and comfort of all of our participants. We will evaluate any possible sanctions with regard to whether or not they provide the safety needed.
